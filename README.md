## The Powerhouse Tech Stack: A Professional Deep Dive

Each technology in this stack has been meticulously selected for its specific capabilities in handling high-volume financial data streams, ensuring robustness, scalability, and real-time insight delivery.

### 1\. Apache Kafka: The Real-time Central Nervous System

  * **Role:** The foundational distributed commit log, acting as our high-throughput, fault-tolerant message broker. It handles all trade data, from raw ingestion to aggregated outputs.
  * **Professional Rationale:**
      * **Scalability & Durability:** Essential for financial markets, allowing us to ingest millions of events per second reliably, even under network failures, preventing critical data loss.
      * **Decoupling:** Enables a **microservices architecture**, where each component (producer, aggregator, API server) operates independently, allowing for isolated development, deployment, and scaling.
      * **Real-time Backbone:** Provides the low-latency messaging crucial for insights in fast-moving markets.
      * **Backpressure Handling:** Efficiently buffers data spikes, preventing downstream systems from being overloaded.

### 2\. Python (`data_producer.py`): The Data Stream Initiator

  * **Role:** Simulates a continuous stream of real-world FINRA ATS trade data. It reads historical synthetic data, enriches it (e.g., `trade_value`, abstract geo-coordinates for venues), and reliably pushes these individual trade events into Kafka.
  * **Professional Rationale:**
      * **Mimicking Real-World Conditions:** Validates the pipeline's ability to handle streaming data and ensures readiness for live market feeds.
      * **Rapid Prototyping & Flexibility:** Python's rich ecosystem is ideal for quickly developing data loaders and adapting to various data formats.
      * **Data Consistency:** Ensures initial data attributes are uniformly applied at the source, streamlining downstream processing.

### 3\. Custom Python Aggregator (`simple_aggregator.py`): The Real-time Analytics Engine

  * **Role:** This custom-built Python component is the analytical core. It consumes raw trade events from Kafka, performs **stateful, windowed aggregations** (specifically, 5-minute tumbling windows) to summarize trade value, quantity, and count per symbol and venue. Aggregated results are then published back into a dedicated Kafka topic.
  * **Professional Rationale:**
      * **Custom Logic & Agility:** Offers ultimate flexibility for specific business logic and rapid iteration, especially where future integration with advanced analytical models (e.g., for prediction) is considered.
      * **Resource Efficiency:** A well-optimized custom consumer can be highly efficient for this project's scale, minimizing operational overhead.
      * **Business Value Translation:** Directly transforms raw events into critical financial metrics, forming the foundation of our heatmap.
      * **Scalable Consumer Group:** Designed to be run in multiple instances within a Kafka consumer group for parallel processing and higher throughput.

### 4\. Flask API (`api_server.py`): The Real-time Data Gateway

  * **Role:** A lightweight Python Flask application acting as our real-time data serving layer. It continuously consumes aggregated trade data from Kafka, maintains an updated in-memory cache (`collections.deque`) of the latest market summaries, and exposes this data via a simple RESTful API endpoint.
  * **Professional Rationale:**
      * **Frontend Decoupling:** Provides a clean, standard HTTP interface for any frontend tool (like KeplerGL or our custom SPA) to consume data, eliminating direct frontend interaction with Kafka.
      * **Performance (Caching):** The in-memory `deque` ensures ultra-fast responses, delivering a smooth and responsive user experience.
      * **Python Ecosystem Harmony:** Leverages Flask's simplicity for rapid API development, integrating seamlessly with our Python-based data processing.
      * **Scalability (API Gateway):** Can be horizontally scaled to handle numerous concurrent requests from multiple client applications.

### 5\. HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js: The Interactive Dashboard (SPA)

  * **Role:** Our **Single-Page Application (SPA)** provides an intuitive and interactive dashboard experience. It fetches data (either from our live Flask API or from a static JSON dump), visualizes key liquidity metrics using dynamic charts (Chart.js), and allows users to explore data points by selecting symbols and navigating through different analytical views.
  * **Professional Rationale:**
      * **Enhanced User Understanding:** Translates complex financial data into digestible, interactive visualizations, fostering active learning over passive consumption.
      * **Rapid UI Development:** Tailwind CSS enables rapid, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing UI creation with utility-first classes, ensuring a consistent and modern design.
      * **Dynamic Visualizations:** Chart.js provides robust, responsive, and easily updateable charts directly in the browser, making data exploration intuitive.
      * **Information Architecture:** The dashboard structure (symbol selector, tabbed views, summary stats) is intentionally designed for optimal user flow and information synthesis, moving beyond simple report replication.

### 6\. KeplerGL: The Geospatial Liquidity Unveiler

  * **Role:** A powerful, browser-based geospatial analytics tool that connects to our Flask API. It renders the aggregated dark pool liquidity data as an intuitive, interactive heatmap on a map interface, enabling dynamic filtering by symbol, venue, and time.
  * **Professional Rationale:**
      * **Actionable Geospatial Insights:** Visualizing financial data on a map immediately reveals "hotspots" of hidden liquidity, patterns of order flow, and market fragmentation that are otherwise obscured.
      * **Superior User Experience:** Its highly interactive nature empowers financial professionals to explore complex data without requiring programming knowledge, facilitating faster, data-driven decision-making.
      * **Efficiency:** As a mature, pre-built visualization tool, it allows us to focus engineering efforts on backend data processing and core analysis, rather than custom frontend map development.

### 7\. Python (`analysis_script.py`, `json_to_csv.py`): The Deep Dive Analytics Layer

  * **Role:** These standalone Python scripts provide robust offline capabilities for deeper data analysis. `analysis_script.py` consumes the aggregated JSON data, performs complex aggregations, statistical computations (like average trade size distributions), and generates a suite of high-quality static analytical plots (e.g., box plots, time-series comparisons of dark vs. lit volume). `json_to_csv.py` facilitates seamless integration with BI tools like Tableau by flattening JSON data.
  * **Professional Rationale:**
      * **Comprehensive Data Understanding:** Enables granular exploration of data characteristics not easily conveyed by real-time dashboards, such as the nuances of trade size distribution specific to dark pools.
      * **Report Generation & Presentation:** Generated plots are suitable for inclusion in formal reports or presentations, providing static, high-fidelity visualizations of key findings.
      * **BI Tool Compatibility:** Facilitates data transfer to industry-standard BI tools (like Tableau) for more extensive ad-hoc analysis and enterprise-level reporting.

## Getting Started: Set Up & Run Locally

Follow these steps to deploy and run the Dark Pool Liquidity Dashboard on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Git:** Version control.
  * **Python 3.9+:** (Recommended Python 3.9 for Faust compatibility, but 3.11 should work with the custom aggregator). Ensure it's in your PATH.
  * **Homebrew (macOS):** For installing Kafka/ZooKeeper easily.
  * **Apache Kafka & ZooKeeper:** The messaging backbone.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/RishiRCarnoli/dark-pool-project.git](https://github.com/RishiRCarnoli/dark-pool-project.git)
cd dark-pool-project
```

### 2\. Install Kafka & ZooKeeper (macOS - Homebrew)

If you don't have Kafka and ZooKeeper set up:

```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh))"

# Install Kafka (includes ZooKeeper)
brew install kafka
```

### 3\. Python Environment Setup

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a Python 3.9 virtual environment (or 3.11 if preferred for other projects)
# Adjust the path to your Python 3.9/3.11 executable if different
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9 -m venv venv_darkpool_py39

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv_darkpool_py39/bin/activate
```

### 4\. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can create it by running `pip install kafka-python pandas flask flask-cors matplotlib seaborn numpy` and then `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### 5\. Place Your Data Source

Ensure the `synthetic_darkpool_heavy.csv` file is in the root of your `dark_pool_project` directory. A sample is provided in this repo.

## Running the Application Components (Order is CRITICAL\!)

You will need **five separate terminal windows/tabs** open to run all components simultaneously. Keep each terminal open as its respective component runs.

### Terminal 1: Start ZooKeeper

```bash
zookeeper-server-start /opt/homebrew/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties
```

### Terminal 2: Start Kafka Broker

```bash
kafka-server-start /opt/homebrew/etc/kafka/server.properties
```

### Terminal 3: Run Data Producer (`data_producer.py`)

  * **Navigate:** `cd /path/to/your/dark_pool_project`

  * **Activate Venv:** `source venv_darkpool_py39/bin/activate`

  * **Run:** `python data_producer.py`

      * This will start generating and pushing synthetic trade data to Kafka.

### Terminal 4: Run Simple Aggregator (`simple_aggregator.py`)

  * **Navigate:** `cd /path/to/your/dark_pool_project`

  * **Activate Venv:** `source venv_darkpool_py39/bin/activate`

  * **Run:** `python simple_aggregator.py`

      * This will consume raw data, perform 5-minute aggregations, and push results to another Kafka topic.

### Terminal 5: Run Flask API Server (`api_server.py`)

  * **Navigate:** `cd /path/to/your/dark_pool_project`

  * **Activate Venv:** `source venv_darkpool_py39/bin/activate`

  * **Run:** `python api_server.py`

      * This will consume aggregated data, maintain an in-memory cache, and serve it via HTTP on `http://localhost:5001`. It will also continuously save the `heatmap_data.json` file.

## Exploring the Dashboard & Visualizations

Once all components are running:

### 1\. Interactive Web Dashboard (SPA)

  * Open your web browser.
  * Navigate to the local HTML file: `file:///path/to/your/dark_pool_project/dark_pool_dashboard.html`
  * **Interaction:** Use the "Select Stock Symbol" dropdown to filter and update all charts dynamically, providing a comprehensive view of liquidity per symbol.

### 2\. Geospatial Liquidity Heatmap (KeplerGL)

  * Open your web browser.
  * Go to the [KeplerGL Demo Page](https://kepler.gl/demo).
  * **Add Data:**
      * Click `+ Add Data`.
      * Select **"Load Map using URL"** (or "Add data from URL" if the label varies).
      * Enter the URL: `http://localhost:5001/api/heatmap_data`
      * Click "Submit" or "Load Map".
  * **Configure Layers:**
      * Map `latitude` and `longitude` to location.
      * Map `total_trade_value` or `total_quantity` to **Size** and **Color** to visualize liquidity density.
      * Utilize the time slider at the bottom to observe liquidity shifts over time.

### 3\. In-depth Offline Analysis

For deeper statistical analysis and high-fidelity plots:

  * Ensure your `api_server.py` has been running for a while to populate `heatmap_data.json`.
  * **Navigate:** `cd /path/to/your/dark_pool_project`
  * **Activate Venv:** `source venv_darkpool_py39/bin/activate`
  * **Run:** `python analysis_script.py`
      * This will generate a series of detailed PNG plots in the newly created `analysis_plots/` directory.
